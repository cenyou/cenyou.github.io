I am a PhD student at the [Bosch Center for AI](https://www.bosch-ai.com/) & [TU Berlin](https://argmin.lis.tu-berlin.de/), where my research focuses on constrained Bayesian active learning.
My earlier work explored the theoretical aspects of algorithms, particularly their convergence properties and the exploration of safe versus unsafe regions.
Recently, I have been focusing on optimizing deployment speed using e.g. transformer models.
I am also experienced in time-series modeling.

Before this, I pursued a Master’s in computational neuroscience at the University of Tübingen, supported by the prestigious [Tsung Cho Chang Foundation scholarship](https://www.daad.org.tw/zh/tcc-stipendium/), awarded to only five students in Taiwan each year.
I completed my undergraduate studies in mathematics at National Tsing Hua University and also spent a year developing database web interfaces while assisting in neurogenetics research.
